# Lab4 Questions :

Q1. Write a Package MCA, which has one class Student. Accept student detail through the parameterized
constructor. Write display() method to display details. Create the main class that will use the package and
calculates total marks and percentages.

Q2. Write a program to create a user-defined package in Java called vehicle and include it in your program
called car. Construct your program as if you are using inheritance, but via packages. Let your parent class
be in the vehicle and let your subclass be in the car.

Q3. Create a package that consists of three public classes, one private and one protected class, and an
interface. Each of the classes consists of at least two methods (set access specifiers of the methods as per
your convenience) and the interface consists of three Abstract classes. Now create a main class that
imports the above-mentioned package and displayed the functionality/results of the methods, which you
have created.

Q4. Write two classes, where first-class contains a sort method that sort the 10 numerical numbers and
printed sorted sequence of the numbers and the second class contains a division method that consists of an
array of 15 numbers, and each number is divided by a numerical number such as arr[]= {10, 20, 30} and
the numerical number is 2, so the output of this array is {5, 10, 15}. To define the possible error handling
mechanism for the above two classes and check how your code handled the exceptions.

Q5. Create a package that consists of two public classes and one private class. Now create another main
class that can access the methods of the package using the fully qualified name concept of the package
and the import package.classname concept. In that case, write two separate java programs to show how
fully qualified name concept of the package and the import package.classname concept works in java
programming.

Q6. Prepare your own scenario and write a java program where you can use four java concepts together
such as inheritance, interface, Abstract class, and package.
